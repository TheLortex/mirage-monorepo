(** OCaml Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) layer *)

(** Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) is a widely used data link layer. The hardware is
   usually a twisted pair or fibre connection, on the software side it consists
   of an Ethernet header where source and destination mac addresses, and a type
   field, indicating the type of the next layer, are present. The Ethernet layer
   consists of network card mac address and MTU information, and provides
   decapsulation and encapsulation. *)
